One of the projects Iâ€™m most proud of is a backend contact management system I built, where users can perform all CRUD operations through APIs. I developed it using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with Mongoose for database modeling.

What made this project more interesting was implementing authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. Only logged-in users with valid tokens could access or modify their own contact data, ensuring secure route protection. I used MongoDB Atlas to host the database, which also helped me get hands-on experience with cloud-based database management.

I'm proud of this project because it was my first real-world application of backend concepts like RESTful APIs, middleware, route protection, and database integration. It gave me a deep understanding of how secure backend systems are structured, and it boosted my confidence to build full-stack applications in the future.
